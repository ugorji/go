# No need to go get, as github knows its working out of this folder.
#
# Most of our code is the same since go1.12; before that we selectively compile files using build constraints.
#
# We test against the following go releases
# - latest production release
# - 2 releases before that
# - an archive version (go 1.11)
# - and a beta/rc of development release (so github can just download an archive of it and use)
#
# Pre-release versions must use semver e.g. as of 20221220, it's '1.20.0-rc.1' 
# TODO: add this back once we resolve the issue with go-codec failing on development branch.
#
# We test amd64 on all releases, and i386 (32-bit) on last production release.
#
# We previously had each tag be its own matrix, but that exploded the number of runs.
# Instead, since the environment is consistent, we just use a bash script to run through all
# the tags for that run.
#
# Finally, we do a go mod edit -droprequire github.com/ugorji/go to circumvent the "missing go.sum entry" error.
# We put a requirements cycle with github.com/ugorji/go to allow folks requiring .../ugorji/go in 2019 to work ok.
# Now, everyone should have updated to a go-codec version >= 1.17 or preferably >= 1.2.0.
# Now is a good time to remove that requirements cycle.
